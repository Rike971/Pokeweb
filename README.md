## Windows Installation 

[Video of installation on a windows computer without python or ruby installed](https://streamable.com/833yr6)

Click the WINDOWS_INSTALL.bat file which will run the included ruby and python installers. 

If you already are using ruby >2.6 and python > 3.6, you can skip to the next step.

Open the Pokeweb folder in powershell or cmd and run 

	$ bundle install

followed by
	
   	 $ pip install ndspy
	 
You can now star the server with 

	$ ruby routes.rb


The Pokeweb server can also be started by clicking and running Pokeweb_Windows.bat. You should be able to view Pokeweb on localhost:4567 in your browser.


### Manual Windows Install

If you are running into issues, try manually installing by clicking and running the ruby and python installers individually. Make sure both versions are in use. If the included installers fail, you can download download windows ruby installer [here](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) and python installer [here](
).
You can check your version by typing 

 	$ ruby -v
and 
	$ python -V

Next, navigate to the Pokeweb root folder in cmd or powershell and run

	$ bundle install

followed by
	
    $ pip install ndspy

If the above steps succeed the server can now be run by running 

	$ ruby routes.rb

or by clicking and running Pokeweb_Windows.bat

## Mac OS Installation

Mac OS already comes with both ruby and python but you will need to update them to newer versions to run Pokeweb if you don't already have ruby >2.6 and python > 3.6. 

The easiest way to do this is to install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
And then to follow these guides to update ruby and python.

Once they are installed, navigate to the project folder in Terminal.app 


	$ bundle install

followed by
	
    $ pip install ndspy

If the above steps succeed the server can now be run by running 

	$ ruby routes.rb



## Getting Started

Place any roms you wish to edit in root folder of Pokeweb and they should show up in the Load Rom dropdown on the homepage. Loading a rom will take you to the a map headers list for the rom while the rest of the editors load in the background. This can take anywhere between 5-15 seconds. In the future you can select an already loaded rom in the Load Project dropdown.

The rest is pretty simple.
<span align="r" style="color:  #1abc9c">
	Any thing this color can be clicked to be edited. 
</span>
If you make an invalid edit the border will turn <span style="color: #ff5555">red</span>, otherwise, your edits are saved automatically. 

To view a history of your edits, go to the Logs tab in the navbar on the rop right.

## Advanced Usage

Upon loading a rom, narc contents are parsed into a more readable format and stored in projects/ROM_NAME/json.
Every json file has a "raw" section and "readable" section.
The "raw" section is data taken straight from the narc and converted into an integer.
The "readable section is the "raw" data converted into a format more understandable to the user. (ex. 1 becomes "Bulbasaur")

You can write your own tools to manipulate the json data as long as you do not change the file locations and validate the inputs yourself.
Json files can have their "readable" data copied over to the "raw" section by running the respective *_writer.py file in the command line 

	$ python python/NARC_NAME_writer.py update FILE_NAME

Data from the "raw" sections can be output to the Narcs, and saved into a rom by running the rom_saver.py file from the command line.

	$ python python/rom_saver.py ROM_NAME
